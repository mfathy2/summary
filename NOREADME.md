**Marie Jackson, PhD, MBA**  
Methodist le Bonheur Healthcare  

---

## Introduction

Clinical trial sites must manage and cover costs associated with conducting research. This includes:
- Creating a **Coverage Analysis (CA)** to outline tests and procedures billable to sponsors or insurers.
- Ensuring accurate billing to prevent risks like **double-billing** or violating the **False Claims Act (FCA)**.
- Tracking hidden costs and negotiating budgets effectively.

---

2. Discuss risks of incorrect billing.
3. Explain the purpose and components of a CA.
4. Define the components of a clinical research budget.
5. Identify hidden costs in research.
6. Discuss insurance billing requirements.

---

## Guidelines and Rules for Research Billing

### Clinical Trial Policy (CTP)
- **1965**: Medicare/Medicaid created.
- **2000**: CMS expanded to include research billing.
- **2007**: CTP revised to guide Medicare coverage for routine patient care in clinical trials.

### False Claims Act (FCA)
- Imposes liability for knowingly or unknowingly submitting false claims to the government.
- Penalties (2020): $11,665–$23,331 per violation plus 3x the amount of each claim.

---

## Coverage Analysis (CA)

### Purpose
- Identify all items and services for each study visit.
- Determine who pays for what (e.g., sponsor, CMS, insurer).

### Routine Costs (Billable)
- Items/services typically covered outside a trial.
- Costs for administering investigational items.
- Monitoring and managing investigational effects.

### Non-Routine Costs (Not Billable)
- Costs for data collection not tied to clinical care.
- Sponsor-provided items/services offered for free.

---

## Clinical Research Budget

### Budget Components
1. **Per-Patient Costs**:
   - Tests, procedures, pharmacy, laboratory fees, and patient stipends.
2. **Study Start-Up Costs**:
   - IRB fees, regulatory support, and budget development.
3. **Personnel Costs**:
   - Time/effort of investigators, coordinators, and data managers.
4. **Additional Costs**:
   - Screen failures, unscheduled visits, document storage, and recruitment.

### Hidden Costs
- Examples: Training, advertising, safety reporting, and medical supplies.

---

## Insurance Billing Requirements

1. **Coding**:
   - National Clinical Trial (NCT) number, modifiers (Q1, Q0), condition codes (30, 53).
2. **Pre-Authorization**:
   - Required for commercial payers but not Medicare.
3. **Double-Billing**:
   - Avoid billing insurers for sponsor-paid items.

---

## Routine Audits
- Reconcile claims with the CA to catch billing errors early.
- Refund government payers for any errors within 60 days.

---

## Summary

Accurate budgeting and billing are critical for maintaining compliance and ensuring clinical trials are financially sustainable. Sites must:
- Create CA grids to reduce risks of billing errors.
- Negotiate budgets using CA insights.
- Track and audit charges throughout the study.
