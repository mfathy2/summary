# Course Summarizer: Clinical Research Series

Welcome to the **Course Summarizer Repository**, where we simplify and summarize complex topics from various clinical research courses for easy understanding and quick reference. This repository is part of an ongoing effort to provide summarized modules, charts, and key insights from a variety of clinical research materials.

## Current Progress

We are currently working through the **Clinical Research: An Introduction** and **The CITI Good Clinical Practice Course for Clinical Trials Involving Drugs and Biologics** series, offering structured summaries for each module. The repository will grow to include multiple courses as we progress.
