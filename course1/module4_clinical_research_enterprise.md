## **Key Components of the Clinical Research Enterprise**

### 1. **Stakeholders**
The clinical research enterprise is a collaborative effort involving various stakeholders:

#### **Major Stakeholders**
1. **Participants**: Study subjects, including patients and healthy volunteers.
2. **Researchers**: Principal investigators, research staff, and clinical trial coordinators.
3. **Sponsors**: Pharmaceutical companies, government agencies (e.g., NIH), and non-governmental organizations.
4. **Regulatory Bodies**: FDA, EMA, and local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).
5. **Healthcare Providers**: Hospitals, academic medical centers, and community health organizations.

#### **Flow of Contributions**
Stakeholders contribute to the clinical research process through funding, oversight, and operational execution.
