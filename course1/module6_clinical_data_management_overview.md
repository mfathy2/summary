### **Key Topics**

#### **1. Stages of Clinical Data Management**
Data management involves several key stages:
- **Data Collection**
  - Collection methods include case report forms (CRFs), electronic health records (EHRs), and wearable devices.
  - Tools like electronic data capture (EDC) systems streamline the process.
- **Data Validation**
  - Ensures consistency and accuracy of the data.
  - Involves automated checks and manual reviews.
- **Data Cleaning**
  - Identifies and resolves discrepancies, missing entries, and errors.
- **Database Lock**
  - Data is finalized for analysis, ensuring no further changes can be made.

#### **2. Data Quality and Integrity**
Data quality and integrity are critical to the success of clinical research:
- **ALCOA+ Principles**: Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available.
- **Audit Trails**: Logs that track changes to the data, ensuring accountability.
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Ensure consistency in data handling.
